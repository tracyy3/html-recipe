    <h1>Summer Rolls - This is how we roll!</h1>
    <hr> 
    <p><b>Summer rolls</b> are one of those dishes I can eat again and again and again. They’re light yet filling and there are so many variations. In the mood for something super savory and spicy? Roll up some spicy beef. It is also interesting to make, simply a do-it- yourself-dish. The mission of chef is to prepare all necessary ingredients, namely rice paper, boiled shrimp, boiled pork, cooked vermicelli noodles, fresh bean sprout, cucumber, lettuce, mint, herbs and of course other things for a mouthwatering sauce. You could replace boiled shrimp, boiled pork by shrimp paste, grilled pork, grilled beef or whatever you like; therefore, there are various versions of gỏi cuốn, but all are indeed tasty. And now, it is your turn to choose your preferred ingredients, place them down middle of a floppy wrapper, with veggie first, then fold over each end and tightly roll the rice paper into a neat tube. Be careful to have a nice piece and finally dip it into a sweet sour spicy sauce. Our love for rolls runs deep.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Super healthy and easy to make, summer rolls are a traditional dish that usually contains pork, prawns, vegetables, and vermicelli wrapped up into a roll made with rice paper. There are literally thousands of variations and they’re completely adaptable and customizable. They’re served fresh with a sauce for dipping, either a mixed fish sauce or a peanut sauce. You can have them for lunch, dinner, snacks, or as appetizers.</p>
